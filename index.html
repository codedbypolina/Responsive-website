              I didn’t want to wait for my web programming classes to start
              learning to code. So I started exploring web development through
              free platforms such as FreeCodeCamp and CodeAcademy. This is when
              I started truly falling in love with Web Devevlopment.
              <br />
              <br />
              Eventually, as I sought more structure, I enrolled in SheCodes to
              boost my knowledge in the fundamentals of front end development
              such as HTML, CSS and JS.

              And here I am, continuing to learn to code at UCF as a junior. A
              lot has changed since I graduated high school in 2018. Within past
              four years, I lived in three different places, changed my major,
              and found a new passion.
              <br />
              <br />
              But most importantly, my feelings of lost and confusion changed to
              excitement for the future and eagerness to improve my skills in
              Web Development.
